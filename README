Scripts to backup usdf.org

The United States Dressage Federation (USDF) records data about it's members,horses, competition results and awards earned, at usdf.org

It is not safe that this data is not backed up.

These scripts are an effort to help remedy this dangerous situation.



implemented scripts:

backup_competitions.sh
  a bash script that saves dressage show results from 2011 to 1990 
  creates 1 directory for each year, and saves show results for shows 0..9999 into the new director

backup_competition_contacts.sh 
  a bash script to save competition contact pages
  scans competiton pages from running backup_competitions.sh extracts the competition contact page urls and saves them
  into the coresponding "year" directory with the competition results.


planned scripts:

backup_medals.sh
  backup rider medal status

backup_amateur_status.sh
  backup rider amateur status

more that I cant think of right now..
